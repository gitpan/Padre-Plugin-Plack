NAME
    Padre::Plugin::Plack - PSGI/Plack plugin for Padre

VERSION
    version 1.200

SYNOPSIS
        # cpan install Padre::Plugin::Plack;
        # Then enable it via L<Padre>, The Perl IDE:
        # Padre > Plugins > Plugin Manager > Plack > enable

DESCRIPTION
    As the name suggests, Padre::Plugin::Plack adds Plack awareness to
    Padre.

    With the plugin installed, opening *.psgi files causes some special
    things to happen.

    PSGI files are really just ordinary Perl files, so Padre does its normal
    Perl lexing/syntax highlighting magic on them, but the real fun starts
    with the Plack-specific features that appear in the per-file graphical
    plackup control panel that shows up.

    The panel lets you run your web app in a Plack server at the click of a
    button, view server output, configure plackup options and launch a web
    browser on the appropriate port.

    The great thing about Plack/PSGI is that unlike my previous plugin
    (Padre::Plugin::WebGUI) which was specific to a single web app (albeit a
    big one), this plugin can be used for any web app built in a web
    framework that supports Plack (Catalyst, CGI::Application, HTTP::Engine,
    etc..). This is the same motivating factor that excites
    Plack::Middleware authors.

    The plugin turns on plackupâs "--reload" option by default, which
    conveniently causes the plack server to reload every time you modify
    your source files in Padre. This makes for quite a nice, if somewhat
    minimal "Plack IDE" experience (this is version 0.01 after all).

    The plugin integrates all of the Plack example "dot-psgiâ"files as
    templates that can be used to create different types of Plack apps
    straight from the GUI menu.

    The pre-populated list of Plack servers and the simple start/stop button
    makes for a nice way of exploring the Plack server ecosystem. You can
    use the other panel options to enter a specific port to run on, toggle
    auto-start mode and pass additional options to plackup (options that
    start with "--" are passed through to the backend server).

    The output panel is similar to the output panel that Padre normally
    displays when you execute Perl files, except that you get one panel per
    .psgi file meaning that you can run multiple plack servers
    simultaneously and independently view their output. The appropriate
    panel is automatically selected when you click on the corresponding file
    tab, and running processes are stopped when you close the tab.

    It should be really easy to turn Padre::Plugin::Plack into new plugins
    that involve the same basic ingredients, namely a file extension and an
    external command for running those files, with a per-file panel for
    command options and output. So I encourage anyone who has a similar
    plugin in mind to steal liberally from Padre::Plugin::Plack (as I did
    from Padre::Plugin::Catalyst - thanks garu++). Ruby Rack support comes
    to mind as a trivial example.

    Make Padre your domain-specific IDE today :)

METHODS
  padre_interfaces
    Declare the Padre interfaces this plugin uses

  registered_documents
    Declare ourselves as the handler for .psgi files

  menu_plugins
    Create the plugin menu

  on_app_load
    Called when Padre loads

  is_psgi_doc
  editor_enable
  editor_changed
  on_panel_load
  on_panel_close
  on_doc_load
    Note that the new tab may or may not exist at this point When triggered
    by user opening a new file (e.g. from on_app_load), tab does not exist
    yet Whereas, when triggered by user creating new app from template, tab
    exists

  on_doc_close
  on_about_load
  load_dot_psgi_examples
  plugin_enable
  plugin_enable
  plackup
  plackdown
  run_command
  build_panel
    This method belonds in Padre::Plugin::Plack::Panel but we keep it here
    to speed up the dev edit-reload cycle
